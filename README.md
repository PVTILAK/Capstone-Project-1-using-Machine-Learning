# Capstone-Project-2-Abalone-Age-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Scientific studies on abalonesrequire knowing the age of an abalone. It involves measuring the number of layers of shell (“rings”) that make up the abalone’s shell.This is done by taking a sample of shell, staining it and counting the number of rings under the microscope.

THE DATA CONSISTS OF 9 FEATURES:

GENDER - (M-MALE, F-FEMALE, I-INFANT)<br>
LENGTH -(LONGEST SHELL MEASUREMENT)<br>
DIAMETER -(PERPENDICULAR TO LENGTH)<br>
HEIGHT -(WITH MEAT IN SHELL)<br>
WHOLE WEIGHT -(WHOLE ABALONE)<br>
SHUCKED WEIGHT -(WEIGHT OF MEAT)<br>
VISCERA WEIGHT -(GUT WEIGHT AFTER BLEEDING)<br>
SHELL WEIGHT -(AFTER BEING DRIED)<br>
RINGS - (+1.5 GIVES THE AGE IN YEARS)
